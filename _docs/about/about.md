      Keep your eyes on things above. There is always more beyond this moment. There is always something you do not know. Don’t give up, keep moving forward. Just because you can’t see what’s up ahead, doesn’t mean it won’t be something great and worthy of living in the calling placed on your life. Do not lose hope, do not be afraid. For why else do we exist? What does a man profit if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul? Everything will fade away, and when it does, what will remain? Flesh is like grass. Regardless of the circumstances your faced with, mountains in front of you, or the waves around you. Who will you choose to be in the midst of all the darkest places? Do everything to glorify our Father in heaven, who is able to bless and increase us more than we could ever ask or think, whether you see what’s up ahead or not. Step into each moment with intention, knowing you are valuable, whether recognized or not. Regardless of where you are starting from, finish what you began. KNOW there is always somewhere, something, someone beyond this. I hope you can take a word of encouragement whether you believe Jesus was God in the flesh on earth and existed or not. I welcome you and hope I get the chance to meet you myself. Everything will fall away, but this one thing remains true, Jesus is Lord. What do you stand on?
