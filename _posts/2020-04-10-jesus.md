Jesus was a real man who existed in history. Celebrated today, but over two thousand years ago, He chose to die for you. Claiming to be God in the flesh, He was sentenced to death. His flesh ripped and mangled; He was beaten, spit on, and mocked, but never complained once. He chose to die for you, when all He had to do is say "I am not God." Can you imagine taking His place, never complaining once, because you love someone so much? He loves you. You. Exactly how you are, dirty, and changing nothing. Nobody else can love you like that.

Jesus was a real man who existed, do you believe now?<br>
