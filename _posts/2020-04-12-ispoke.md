People need to hear what you have to say. I want to encourage anybody that believes to be encouraged to share what you believe and what Jesus did. No matter how embarrassing the circumstance. Be encouraged. His message is love. Don’t be ashamed. Don’t be afraid. Don’t lose heart. Share who you are with people, don’t be afraid to confront the fear of rejection. The outward man dies, but the inward man is what lives. The treasure is within the earthen vessel. What is seen is temporary, what is unseen is eternal, let that be your hope today and thank God for what He did.. I spoke.
<br><br>

<div style="text-indent: 20px;">"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed— always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body. For we who live are always delivered to death for Jesus’ sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So then death is working in us, but life in you. 
</div>
<br>

<div style="text-indent: 20px;">And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, “I believed and therefore I spoke,” we also believe and therefore speak, knowing that He who raised up the Lord Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us with you. For all things are for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God. 
</div>
<br>

<div style="text-indent: 20px;">Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
</div>
<br>

<div style="text-indent: 20px;">For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven, if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee. 
</div>
<br>

<div style="text-indent: 20px;">So we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord. For we walk by faith, not by sight. We are confident, yes, well pleased rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord."
